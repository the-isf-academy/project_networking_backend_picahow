## Setup

1. Ensure you have Banjo installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory.

## Running the Server

To start the Banjo server, run the following command in your terminal:
banjo --debug
The server will start, and you can access the API endpoints using the base URL followed by the specific endpoint paths.

## Playing the Game

1. Start a new game by sending a GET request to `/millionaire/start_game`.
2. Retrieve the next question by sending a GET request to `/millionaire/random_question`.
3. Answer the question by sending a POST request to `/millionaire/answer` with the question `id` and your `answer`. All answers are caps sensitive.
4. Continue playing until you either answer all questions correctly or provide an incorrect answer.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute to this project by adding more questions or replacing hints. You can use the `/millionaire/add_question` endpoint to add new questions to the game and the `/millionaire/replace_hint` endpoint to add new hints to the game.
